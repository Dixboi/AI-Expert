# Describe cloud concepts (25–30%)
## Describe cloud computing

### Define cloud computing

Cloud computing: Delivery of computing services over the internet. 

### Describe the shared responsibility model

Consumer
- Information and data stored
- Devices that are allowed to connect
- Accounts and identities of the people, services, and devices

Provider
- Datacenter
- Network
- Hosts

Depends on the model
- Operating systems (*SaaS, PaaS = Provider* | *IaaS = Customer*)
- Network controls (*SaaS = Provider* | *PaaS = Shared* | *IaaS = Customer*)
- Applications (*SaaS = Provider* | *PaaS = Shared* | *IaaS = Customer*)
- Identity and infrastructure (*SaaS, PaaS = Shared* | *IaaS = Customer*)

**SaaS: Software as a Service**

**PaaS: Platform as a Service**

**IaaS: Infrastructure as a Service**

### Define cloud models, including public, private, and hybrid

Private cloud: A dedicated computing environment for a single company. More flexibility but also costs more.

Public cloud: A computing environment where anyone can purchase.

Hybrid cloud: Both private and public.

Multi-cloud: Uses two or more *public* clouds.

#### AZURE TOOLS/SERVICES
1. **Azure Arc**: Set of technologies that helps you to manage your cloud environment.
2. **Azure VMware Solution**: Lets you run your VMware Workloads in Azure.

### Describe the consumption-based model

CapEx: Capital Expenditure. Typically a one-time up-front expense.
OpEx: Operational Expenditure. Spending money overtime based on used resources.

### Compare cloud pricing models

Pay-as-you-go. You pay only on the services that you use. When you're done using cloud resources, you give them back and will not pay until the next usage.

## Describe the benefits of using cloud services
### Describe the benefits of high availability and scalability in the cloud

Availability: Uptime
Scalability: Handling demand

High Availablity: Maximum availability regardless of disruption or events that may occur.

SLA: Service Level Agreement. The agreement between the provider and the customer on how available is the service. If the availability is not met, the provider will provide credits to the customer.

Scalability: Ability to adjust resources to meet demand. If demand is low, resource usage is low. If demand is high, resource usage is high.
- Vertical Scaling: Making the resources more powerful (e.g. more CPUs or RAMs)
- Horizontal Scaling: Adding more resources (e.g. more virtual machines and containers)

### Describe the benefits of reliability and predictability in the cloud

Reliability: Ability of a system to recover from failures and continue to function.

Predictability: predicts the resources needed and the cost
- Performace: Predicting the resources needed
- Cost: Focused on predicting or forecasting the cost of the resources used or needed

### Describe the benefits of security and governance in the cloud

Security: Can pick a cloud solution according to desired control. Well suited to distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks.

Governance: Has templates to ensure that deployed resources meet corporate standards and government regulatory requirements. Can flag any resources that are out of compliance and provides mitigation strategies. 

### Describe the benefits of manageability in the cloud

Management **of** the cloud: **what** is managing cloud resources
- automatically scale resource deployment
- deploy resources based on preconfigured templates
- monitor health of resources and automatically replace failing ones
- receive automatic alerts based on configured metric

Management **in** the cloud: **how** to manage cloud environment
- web portal
- command line interface (CLI)
- APIs
- PowerShell

## Describe cloud service types
### Describe infrastructure as a service (IaaS)

Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)
- most flexbile because you have the maximum control of your cloud resources
- basically renting hardware

Possible scenarios:
- Lift-and-shift migration: Setting up cloud resources similar to on-premise datacenter. Running from on-premise to IaaS.
- Testing and development: Already have configurations for development and test environments for replicating rapidly. 

### Describe platform as a service (PaaS)

Platform as a Service (PaaS)
- maintains the licensing or patching of operating systems (OSs) and databases
- responsibilities are shared on **network controls**, **applications**, and **identity and directory infrastructure**

Possible scenarios:
- Development framework: Provides a framework for developing or customizing cloud-based application. E.g. Excel Macros
- Analytics or business intelligence: Can mine data for doing analysis or other processes

### Describe software as a service (SaaS)

Software as a Service (SaaS)
- basically renting fully developed application

Possible scenarios:
- Email (MS Outlook)
- Messaging (MS Teams)

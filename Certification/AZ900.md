# Describe cloud concepts (25–30%)
## Describe cloud computing

### Define cloud computing

Cloud computing: Delivery of computing services over the internet. 

### Describe the shared responsibility model

Consumer
- Information and data stored
- Devices that are allowed to connect
- Accounts and identities of the people, services, and devices

Provider
- Datacenter
- Network
- Hosts

Depends on the model
- Operating systems (*SaaS, PaaS = Provider* | *IaaS = Customer*)
- Network controls (*SaaS = Provider* | *PaaS = Shared* | *IaaS = Customer*)
- Applications (*SaaS = Provider* | *PaaS = Shared* | *IaaS = Customer*)
- Identity and infrastructure (*SaaS, PaaS = Shared* | *IaaS = Customer*)

**SaaS: Software as a Service**

**PaaS: Platform as a Service**

**IaaS: Infrastructure as a Service**

### Define cloud models, including public, private, and hybrid

Private cloud: A dedicated computing environment for a single company. More flexibility but also costs more.

Public cloud: A computing environment where anyone can purchase.

Hybrid cloud: Both private and public.

Multi-cloud: Uses two or more *public* clouds.

#### AZURE TOOLS/SERVICES
1. **Azure Arc**: Set of technologies that helps you to manage your cloud environment.
2. **Azure VMware Solution**: Lets you run your VMware Workloads in Azure.

### Identify appropriate use cases for each cloud model

### Describe the consumption-based model

CapEx: Capital Expenditure. Typically a one-time up-front expense.
OpEx: Operational Expenditure. Spending money overtime based on used resources.

### Compare cloud pricing models

Pay-as-you-go. You pay only on the services that you use. When you're done using cloud resources, you give them back and will not pay until the next usage.

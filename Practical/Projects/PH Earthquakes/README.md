# Philippine Earthquakes
A Python notebook that web scrapes a Philippine website to extract data about earthquakes.

## Purpose
I want to gather earthquake data from the Philippines, however the data displayed on PHIVOLCS are limited only by the recent month. So I want a consolidated data, not just from the displayed latest data.

The data can be used for the following:
1. Analysis of the Philippines' most hitted regions
2. Correlation with casualties alongside with other disasters

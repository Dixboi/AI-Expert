# Welcome to my GitHub Portfolio
Here lies all of my learnings related to becoming an official Artificial Intelligence Expert.

I wanted to focus on the following:
- **Data Analysis**: without understanding data, it's hard to build AI models and run them
- **Data Engineering**: ensures that AI systems or softwares will get the data needed
- **Data Science**: helps in experimentation and understading AI models to its core
- **Machine Learning**: applying AI models in the right situation
- **Data and AI Ethics**: ensures that the data and AI system is being used in a proper manner

This repo is divided into three parts:
1. **Certification**: preparation, collection, and notes for all of the certifications that I'm trying and I've taken
2. **Practical**: application of all my learnings like big or small projects
3. **Theoretical**: collection of all the resources that help me to understand my target fields

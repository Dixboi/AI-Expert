# Welcome to my GitHub Portfolio!
Here lies all of my learnings related to becoming an official Artificial Intelligence Expert.

## LEARNING DIVISIONS
For all of my learnings, I want to separate them into divisions.

### 🤖 Automation
Helps to make sure to lessen repititive tasks and provide an easier workflow

### 📊 Data Analysis
Without understanding data, it's hard to build AI models and run them

### 🛠️ Data Engineering
Ensures that AI systems or softwares will get the data needed

### 🔬 Data Science
Helps in experimentation and understading AI models to its core

### 📟 Machine Learning
Applying AI models in the right situation

### ⚖️ Data and AI Ethics
Ensures that the data and AI system is being used in a proper manner

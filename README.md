# Welcome to my GitHub Portfolio
Here lies all of my learnings related to becoming an Artificial Intelligence Expert.

I wanted to focus on the following:
1. Data Analysis: without understanding data, it's hard to build AI models and run them
2. Data Engineering: ensures that AI systems or softwares will get the data needed
3. Data Science: helps in experimentation and understading AI models to its core
4. Machine Learning: applying AI models in the right situation
5. Data and AI Ethics: ensures that the data and AI system is being used in a proper manner
